           <h1> The City Of Gold</h1>
           <p>The main Witwatersrand gold reef was discovered in June 1884 on
                the farm Vogelstruisfontein by Jan Gerritse Bantjes that triggered
                the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witwatersrand">Witwatersrand</a>  Gold Rush and the founding of Johannesburg in 1886. 
                The discovery of gold rapidly attracted people to the area, making necessary
                a name and governmental organisation for the area. Johann and Johannes were 
                common male names among the Dutch of that time; two men involved in surveying the
                area for the best location of the city, Christian Johannes Joubert and Johann Rissik, 
                are considered the source of the name by some</p>

                 [jʊəˈɦanəsbœrχ]; also known as Jozi, Jo'burg, and eGoli)[1]
                 is the largest city in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa">South Africa</a>  and one of the 50 largest urban areas in the world.

                <p><img src="wits.jpg" id="w1" />The Witwatersrand (locally the Rand or, less commonly, the Reef)
                     is a 56-kilometre-long (35 mi), north-facing scarp in South Africa.
                      It consists of a hard, erosion-resistant quartzite metamorphic rock, 
                      over which several north-flowing rivers form waterfalls, which account for the name Witwatersrand,
                       meaning "ridge of white waters" in Afrikaans.[1] This east-west-running scarp can be traced with
                        only one short gap, from Bedfordview (about 10 km [6 mi] west of O.R. Tambo International Airport) 
                        in the east, through Johannesburg and Roodepoort, to Krugersdorp in the west (see the diagram at left below).[2]</p>
